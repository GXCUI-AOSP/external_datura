      "message": "From what I recall part of the reason private DNS was needed was that the connectivity check used to break when global cleartext was applied and private dns was not set. I\u0027m not sure if we worked around it in netd or if other changes have been made to AOSP that work around this. Also I\u0027m able to search something like www.yahoo.com on chromium after a fresh install, connecting to WiFi and applying global cleartext (no other steps taken)",
